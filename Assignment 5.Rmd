Salamander abundance at both old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek appear to follow the same trends. [DATA TRENDS]

##### B. *Salamander Abundance by Channel Type* 

**Table 1. Salamander Abundance by Channel Type in Clear Cut and Old Growth sections of Mack Creek**
```{r}
# Only keep observations from 2017. Sort by cascade, pool, and side-channel observations for both the clear cut and old growth sections of  Mack Creek (removing isolated pools data).
salamander_2017<- salamander %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  select(year, unittype, section) %>% 
  filter (unittype %in% c("SC", "C", "P")) %>% 
  count(unittype, section)

# Rearrange data using pivot_wider so that clear cut and old growth are there own columns
salamander_2017_table <- salamander_2017 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = section, values_from = n)

# Rename observations
salamander_2017_table$unittype[salamander_2017_table$unittype == "C"] <-"Cascade"
salamander_2017_table$unittype[salamander_2017_table$unittype == "P"] <-"Pool"
salamander_2017_table$unittype[salamander_2017_table$unittype == "SC"] <-"Side-channel"

# Calculate percentages, and rename columns
salamander_2017_perc <- salamander_2017_table %>% 
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") 

salamander_2017_table_perc <- salamander_2017_table %>% 
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "col") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front") %>% 
  rename("Clear Cut" = CC) %>% 
  rename( "Old Growth" = OG) %>% 
  rename ("Channel Type" = unittype)

#create a nicer table using kable function
kable(salamander_2017_table_perc) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", 
                full_width = F,
                position = "left") %>% 
  row_spec(1, background = "#EAF1FB") %>% 
  row_spec(2, background = "#CCD5E1") %>%
  row_spec(3, background = "#AFB9C6")

# QUESTION: GET PERCENTAGE BY ROW OR COLUMN??
```

##### C. *Salamander Abundance by Channel Type* 
```{r}
# Is there a significant effect of forest condition (old growth or clear cut) on where in the channel salamanders are found (channel classification)? Run a chi test to test for this b/c chi tests are used to compare proportions/count data. 
salamander_chi_data <- salamander_2017_table%>% 
  select(-"unittype")

salamander_chi_test <- chisq.test(salamander_chi_data)

# salamander_chi_test

# p-value > .05 so retain the null, meaning there is NO significant difference between forest condition and where in the channel salamanders are found. 

```

There is not a significant effect of forest condition, either old growth or clear cut, on Salamander abundance across cascades, side-channels, or pools ($\chi$^2^(`r salamander_chi_test$parameter`)=`r round(salamander_chi_test$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round (salamander_chi_test$p.value,2)`). At `r round(salamander_2017_perc$CC[1]*100,0)`% and `r round(salamander_2017_perc$OG[1]*100,0)`%, the majority of Salamanders from both clear cut and old growth sections of Mack Creek were found at Cascades. Side-channels accounted for the next greatest abundance of the salamanders from both sections sampled (`r round(salamander_2017_perc$CC[3]*100,0)`% and `r round(salamander_2017_perc$OG[3]*100,0)`% repectively). Pools contained the fewest amount of salamanders accross both sections of Mack Creek, accounting for only `r round(salamander_2017_perc$CC[2]*100,0)`% and `r round(salamander_2017_perc$OG[2]*100,0)`% of salamanders observed. 

##### D. *Salamander Weights accross clear cut and old growth forest sections (2017)* 
```{r}
# Find the mean weight of salamanders in both the clear cut and old growth sections of the creek in 2017. Remove "NA" values
salamander_weight <- salamander %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  select(section, weight) %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight,na.rm = TRUE ))
```

```{r}
# Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in the two forest sections (clear cut and old growth) in 2017? Okay to use t-test, because under the central limit theorem, the means of the samples will be normally distributed because these are large enough sample sizes AND using a welch's t-test does not assume equal variance.  
weight_2017 <- salamander %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  select(weight, section)

cc_weight_2017 <- weight_2017 %>% 
  filter(section == "CC") %>% 
  pull(weight)
  
og_weight_2017 <- weight_2017 %>% 
  filter(section == "OG") %>% 
  pull(weight)

cc_og_weights_ttest_2017 <- t.test(cc_weight_2017, og_weight_2017)
#cc_og_weights_ttest_2017 

# test for effect size
cc_og_weights_2017_d <- effsize::cohen.d(cc_weight_2017, og_weight_2017, na.rm = TRUE)

#cc_og_weights_2017_d

# p-value > .05 so means of salamanders from clear cut and old growth sections did not differ significantly.Effect size is negligable
```

Salamanders measured from clear cut and old growth forested sections of Mack Creek did not significantly differ in weight (t(`r round(cc_og_weights_ttest_2017$parameter, 2)`)) = `r round(cc_og_weights_ttest_2017$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(cc_og_weights_ttest_2017$p.value, 2)`), with a negligible effect size (Cohenâ€™s d = `r round(cc_og_weights_2017_d$estimate[1],2)`).[ADD MORE]

salamander_summary <- salamander %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>%

```{R}
#Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in pools vs. cascades vs. side-channels in 2017? 

# Check for normality with histogram plot
##ggplot(salamander_channels, aes (x = weight))+
 ## geom_histogram()+
  ##facet_wrap(~unittype)

# does not look normally distributed, but central limit theorem tells us that the means will be normally distributed (because large sample sizes).

#Check for normality with qq plot
##ggplot(data = salamander_channels, aes(sample = weight)) +
 ## geom_qq(aes(color = unittype),
                 ##alpha = 0.5,
                 ##show.legend = FALSE) +
  ##facet_wrap(~unittype, scales = "free")

# Does still not normally distributed, but large sample sizes so the central limit theorem tells us that the means will still be normally distributed

# Run levenes statistical test to test for equal variance
#leveneTest(weight ~ unittype, data = salamander_channels)

# p value > .05 so we retain the null hypothesis of equal variances

# since we know that the means are normally distributed, and we can assume equal variance, and observations are likely to be independent of one another,  we proceed with a one-way-ANOVA test to compare group means.

# Run one-way ANOVA
salamander_anova <- aov(weight ~ unittype, data = salamander_channels)

#summary(salamander_anova)

# p value <.01 so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that mean weights are the same across all channel types. 

# Run Tukey test to find out which combinations of channel types significantly differ in mean salamander weights
#TukeyHSD(salamander_anova)

#P-C do not differ significantly, SC-C do not differ significantly, SC-P DO differ significantly
```

An additional method for comparing salamander weights across the three channel types would be to compare ranks of the measured weights using a Kruskal Willis statistical test. This is often thought of as a comparison of means, and is appropriate for this dataset because there are many outliers. Since skew and outliers have more of an effect on mean, comparing medians may make for a more appropriate comparison of Salamander weights across the three Mack Creek channel types.
